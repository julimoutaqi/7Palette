Welcome to my first self-programmed page which makes me very proud. Have fun!

What are the seven basic emotions? The 7 basic emotions (according to Paul Ekman) are the feelings whose mimic expression is the same in all cultures of the world.

They are obviously innate and are not learned.

This is how it works:

1. You enter one of the seven basic emotions in the search box above
2. A color palette appears that matches the emotion you are looking for
3. When you press the color, it is automatically copied to your clipboard
4. And here we go: you can implement the color into your designs

#App starten mit Befehl: python 7palette.py
